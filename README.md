# **Tridymake**

Tridy (pronounced like "treaty") is an imperative/scripted data language and limited programming language that allows declarative data (defined using formats like JSON, YAML, XML, etc.) to be constructed dynamically and as non-redundantly (in terms of user input and DRY principles) as possible. It includes a powerful system of pathing and path expressions for hierarchical data using non-unique (or not required to be unique) tags, permitting composition with user-defined granularity, and includes places for user-generated input using "function modules" defineable in Tridy's parent language (JavaScript).

The language is similar to SQL following that it's imperative, but is designed for working with hierarchical as opposed to tabular or "reference-driven" data. Without references, this means it's slower and not the most memory-efficient, but this also makes it much more flexible when it comes to "cross-cutting" data, and makes the data easier to mentally grasp than reference or inheritance-based models that rely on a lot of internal coupling.

Tridymake is an interpreter for the Tridy language, and a transpiler for configuration data. It was built with the intent of helping to create procedurally-generated content for gamified cybersecurity without being too implementation-specific.

Tridymake is programmed in JavaScript ES6 and requires at least NodeJS v18.9.0 to run (due to using NodeJS's then-updated *readline* module).
